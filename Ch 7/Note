1) String compression
aaaabbccccd -> a62b3c1d
if compressed is not shorter than original, return original
-> need stringbuilder / memory, cannot do this in place

string concatenation operates in O(n^2) time

2) Useful string operations
- Check if something is an arithmetic operator
        - "+-*/".contains(tokekn)

3) Usage of do while
- do while is executed at least once
- useful for building strings
