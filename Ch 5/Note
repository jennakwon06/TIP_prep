1) Isolating the lowest (rightmost) that is 1
y = x & ~(x-1) : y is 1 at exactly the lowest bit of x that is 1
y = x & (x-1) : lowest bit is turned off

2) Large number of bit fiddling operations
"Whenever you have to do a large number of operations, two keys to performance are processing multiple
bits at a time, and caching results in an array-based lookup table".

Caching -> hash table with 2^16 entries = 65536; feasible
Index into the hash table by rightshifting the original number

3) Operators
XOR is associative, commutative
