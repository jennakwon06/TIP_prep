Common Questions


I often get stuck writing recursive helpers because I don't know which arguments will make method clean, and how to effectively
use return statements.
- If you are returning this OR that, then use ternary statement directly in return
- Use outer IF statements if you want to prevent recursion call completely


1. Compute LCA
    - How does this differ with BT?

2. Intervals
    - Range lookup

3. Linked list to BST

4. Create minimum height tree & reconstruct tree with input array
    - Use start / end indices directly as function arguments to create "subslicing" effect without using memory
