Recursive problem - from beginning to end

1) Detect if a problem is a recursive problem
- compute the nth..
- compute the first n...
- compute all...

2) Come up with a mathematical formula to cover all cases and to express the problem insubproblems

3) Convert the recursive formula to code

4) Catalan Numbers - look for patterns?
- Generate all binary trees 16.8
- Generate all matching parentheses 16.6
