Why operate from back rather than forward?
- When doing array operation, think about running towards a goal and throwing hurdles in my way - this prevents me from proceeding
- Then think about runnign towards a gola and throwing hurdles behind my way - I can still proceed forward
- This applies to problem such as ...
       - Rotate matrix in place
       - Store data in place while iterating

Generating random permutation
- why does Fisher-Yates shuffle generate a random permutation w/ equal probabilities?
- why does this not work?
       PERMUTATE(A):
           n = A.length
           for i = 1 to n
               swap A[i] and A[random(1,n)]
