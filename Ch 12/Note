Calculating Median
- When signs are opposite: (H + L) / 2
- When signs are the same: (H - L) / 2 + L

Binary Search Variants
1. Dealing with duplicates
-   find endpoints
- may turn into linear time complexity, unfortunately.
2. Find first occurrence of k
- Worst case: When all elements are k. brute force search at any point wouldn't
- find any occurrence, and binary search for left endpoint
3. Find first element greater than k
- find any occurrence, and binary search for its right endpoint, and return the next indx?

4. Cyclically sorted array
- compare A[mid] to A[right].
- duplicates? lienar search.

Generalized Search
- Tradeoffs between RAM and computation time
- Randomization for elimination
- Bit level manipulation to identify missing elements
